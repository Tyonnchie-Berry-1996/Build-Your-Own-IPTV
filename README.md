# Build-Your-Own-IPTV

An IPTV playlist builder that works like a modular conveyor belt. Start by selecting a source playlist, then search channels or groups in batches. After every 5 searches, a GUI pops up so you can precisely choose what to import.
The tool outputs a clean, custom M3U using regex matching and sed, while preserving the integrity of your original files.
